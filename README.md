# surajgoraya.ca

Personal site that I use for random things.

Warning: Currently in the middle of re-writing this & like always, i may change frameworks. This is currently in Svelte.

## Uses:

A really cool minimalist CSS framework called [Sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura).

Note that I've modified the version in this repo to use CSS variables.

It also used [Svelte]('https://kit.svelte.com)

## How to Run:

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
